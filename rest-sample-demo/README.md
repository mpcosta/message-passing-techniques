# Rest Sample Demo
This is a simple app that demonstrates how to use Flask to create a REST API. It also serves as a starter template for users to begin experimenting with writing their own REST API endpoints.

This also includes a simple client that demonstrates how to make requests to the REST API.

## Running the app (Server)
1. Install Flask: `pip install Flask`
2. Run the app: `flask run`

## Running the client (Client)
1. Install requests: `pip install requests`
2. Run the client: `python client.py`

The application should be available at `127.0.0.1:5000`.
